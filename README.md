Class-based Views and Templates 

N/B: If you decide to put your 'templates' folder in your main directory, then you have to add "DIRS": [BASE_DIR / "templates"] under TEMPLATES in your core settings.py

- In your app urls.py, when using Class-Based Views, you always add as_view() at the end of the view name

- To run tests on your terminal,  type python manage.py test
